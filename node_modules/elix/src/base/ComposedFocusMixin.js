/**
 * Normalizes focus treatment for custom elements with Shadow DOM
 *
 * This mixin exists because the default behavior for mousedown should set the
 * focus to the closest ancestor of the clicked element that can take the focus.
 * As of Nov 2018, Chrome and Safari don't handle this as expected when the
 * clicked element is reassigned across more than one slot to end up inside a
 * focusable element. In such cases, the focus will end up on the body. Firefox
 * exhibits the behavior we want. See
 * https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/773.
 *
 * This mixin normalizes behavior to provide what Firefox does. When the user
 * mouses down inside anywhere inside the component's light DOM or Shadow DOM,
 * we walk up the composed tree to find the first element that can take the
 * focus and put the focus on it.
 *
 * @module ComposedFocusMixin
 * @param {Constructor<ReactiveElement>} Base
