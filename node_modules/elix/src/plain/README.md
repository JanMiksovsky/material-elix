This folder contains the Plain reference design system built on the Elix base components in the peer `base` folder. Those base components are not designed to be directly instantiable, but these Plain components, in contrast, _are_ designed to be ready for immediate use on pages.

The Plain components add a minimal degree of styling on top of the base components so that the components are usable. Example: the base [AutoCompleteComboBox](https://elix.org/documentation/AutoCompleteComboBox) is not meant to be instantiated, but the [PlainAutoCompleteComboBox](https://elix.org/documentation/PlainAutoCompleteComboBox) is.

The "Plain" name is meant to convey a core principle of this particular design system: it's meant to be as plain as possible so that it can fit in with a variety of application styles. One way of thinking about the Plain components is to imagine what the next 100 HTML elements might look like.
