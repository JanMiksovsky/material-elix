This src folder has three subfolders:

- src/core – The ReactiveElement base class, the core files it’s built from, plus utilities
- src/base – Component mixins and generic component base classes (which typically can’t be instantiated directly)
- src/plain – Components in the new Plain reference design system, which can be instantiated on a page and also show how to create a design system on top of the Elix base classes
