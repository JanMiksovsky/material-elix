This repo is a quick experiment to show a hypothetical implementation of Google's Material design system on top of the [Elix](https://elix.org) base web components. The `/src` folder contains a Material version of the Elix Drawer component. That folder also includes two other components, an overlay frame and a scrim, which are used to replace the stock parts in the Elix Drawer in order to make it into a Material drawer.
